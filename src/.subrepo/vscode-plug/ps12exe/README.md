# ps12exe VS Code Extension

This extension provides a convenient way to compile your PowerShell (`.ps1`) scripts into executable files (`.exe`) directly within Visual Studio Code, leveraging the power of the `ps12exe` PowerShell module. It adds context menu items and an editor title button for quick access to the compilation feature and the `ps12exe` GUI.

## Features

This extension integrates with VS Code to offer the following features for `.ps1` files:

* **Compile via Editor Title Button:** A dedicated button appears in the top-right corner of the editor window when a `.ps1` file is active, allowing you to trigger compilation with a single click.

    *(Note: Replace `images/editor-button-placeholder.png` with an actual screenshot of the button in VS Code.)*

* **Compile via Editor Context Menu:** Right-click anywhere within an open `.ps1` file's editor, and you'll find a "Compile To Exe" option in the context menu.

    *(Note: Replace `images/editor-context-placeholder.png` with an actual screenshot of the context menu.)*

* **Compile via Explorer Context Menu:** Right-click on a `.ps1` file in the VS Code File Explorer, and you'll find a "Compile To Exe" option.

    *(Note: Replace `images/explorer-compile-context-placeholder.png` with an actual screenshot of the explorer context menu for compilation.)*

* **Launch ps12exe GUI:** Right-click on a `.ps1` file in the VS Code File Explorer, and you can select "ps12exeGUI" to launch the graphical interface of the `ps12exe` module for more advanced compilation options.

    *(Note: Replace `images/explorer-gui-context-placeholder.png` with an actual screenshot of the explorer context menu for the GUI.)*

* **Integrated Notifications:** Get feedback on compilation success or failure directly through VS Code notifications.

## Requirements

To use this extension, you need:

* **Visual Studio Code** (version 1.99.0 or higher).
* **PowerShell:** You need either Windows PowerShell 5.1+ or PowerShell Core (pwsh) installed. The extension primarily targets Windows due to the nature of compiling to `.exe` files, and the current implementation explicitly calls `powershell.exe`.
* The **`ps12exe` PowerShell Module:** This extension is just an interface; the actual compilation is done by the `ps12exe` module. You must install it in your PowerShell environment. Open PowerShell and run:

    ```powershell
    Install-Module -Name ps12exe -Scope CurrentUser # Or -Scope AllUsers
    ```

    For more details on `ps12exe` itself, its features, and advanced usage, please refer to the [official ps12exe GitHub repository](https://github.com/steve02081504/ps12exe).

## Extension Settings

This extension currently does not contribute any user-configurable settings through VS Code's settings interface. Compilation uses the default `ps12exe` parameters (`-file <input> -output <output>`). For advanced options, please use the integrated `ps12exeGUI` command or run `ps12exe` manually in a terminal.

## Known Issues

* The extension relies on the `ps12exe` PowerShell module being correctly installed and discoverable in your PowerShell environment. If compilation fails, verify the `ps12exe` module is installed and accessible by running `Get-Command ps12exe` in PowerShell.
* The default compilation command is basic. For features like adding icons, including extra files, selecting platform/architecture, etc., you must use the `ps12exeGUI` or run the `ps12exe` command manually with parameters.
* Detailed error messages from `ps12exe` itself might only appear in the VS Code output console or notifications, and may require referring to the `ps12exe` documentation for interpretation.
* Primarily tested on Windows environments. Compatibility with PowerShell Core on other operating systems might vary based on `ps12exe`'s capabilities there.
